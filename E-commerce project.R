#Sources review shows that to find proper data is complicated process. I faced with following problems:
#1 - Structure of data is different. As I have United Kingdom e-commerce data, I was looking for additional e-data of UK e-store. All my attempts were unsuccessful.
#2 - Data has different format. I used command "read.table" to convert data in R and sign of separater differs for each data. It is not easy to understand what is "sep" from the first sight.
#3 - Title of data differes what is exactly in it. For example, I found the "Amazon data" but data was not about e-commerce.
#4 - I am still looking for nice data :)

str(data3) #data is not clear, for example there are characters and numbers in "discription" "country" columns. Invoicedate column does not look good.
View(data3) #I'm wrong, tha data looks fine at the table.
table(data3$Country) # I have 446 unspecified countries and 61 European Community. I probably should to drop them. EIRE is Republic of Ireland
#How to drop the unspecified data?

summary(data3) # I have negative quantity I should check Quantaty column
table(data3$Quantity)
