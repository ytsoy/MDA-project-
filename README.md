# Marketing Data Analysis Project
## **Women's Shoe Prices**

In today’s competitive market, luxury brands have to connect with customers in more creative ways than ever. With mainstream brands pushing up into the premium category and traditional luxury fashion and accessories brands moving into the mass market. It means that real luxury has to distinguish itself cleverly. As shoe designer Christian Louboutin says, *“Luxury is the possibility to stay close to your customers, and do things that you know they will love.”*

Luxury brand cannot stop their offering at the product; they must go beyond that to offer unique services or rituals. This can start with something as simple as attentive sales people and prompt customer service, but it should really go beyond that to create a consumption “ritual” that allows customers to experience the brand.

To get the perfect pair, people are willing to wait in line for days and pay insane markups. What is the reason? How do marketing campaigns influence on consumer behaviour?

According to McKinsey, 50% of luxury goods buying decisions are influenced by what consumers hear or see online.

Marketing campaings are aimed on selling the products by creating and sharing educational, entertaining or insightful information with the target audience. Content should make it easy for the customers to learn, search for and purchase the products and services.

**The goal** of the project is to analyze dataset of women'r shoe price and determine the average cost of non-luxury and luxury brand. The difference between a luxury brand’s average price and the average price of all non-luxury shoes shows a proxy for the “brand value” of each designer label.

**Dataset** contains of 10,000 women's shoes and their associated information. The data is provided by Datafiniti's Product Database. Data includes shoe name, brand, price, and etc. The data is part of a larger data set that was used to determine brand markup and pricing strategies for luxury shoes.

**Statistics**:
- 25,396 product listings;

- 379 luxury and non-luxury brands;

- 8 retailers sourced.

**Outcomes**
Which shoe brands are the most expensive and how much will a typical pair cost. Define the "brand value" we will be able to learn the company's marketing campain and consider its competative advantages.
